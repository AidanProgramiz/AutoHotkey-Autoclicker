# AutoHotkey-Autoclicker
A Autoclicker made from AutoHotkey that click rapidly when you hold the mouse key you want to rapidly be pressed

BTW. This program was made using AutoHotkey so you might wanna install it first before you run the "main.ahk", you could use the ahk to exe but using the raw code is recommended than compiling it into an executable.
